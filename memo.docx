At the start of the semester, my website designing knowledge consisted of editing font sizes on freewebs. 
At the end of the semester, I am able to create an interactive webpage that animates itself. 
The biggest amount of progress I achieved in this class was gathering information from inspect element. 
Not only did that allow me to investigate what other websites are doing, but it is also a convenient simulation for small screen sizes.
I used this knowledge particularly during project three in order to make a responsive website. 
Even though I am pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS, I am still quite a novice with Javascript. 
We were not introduced to Javascript until the final month of school and I still have no idea how to use the library of jQuery to assist me.
